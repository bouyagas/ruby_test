I have general knowledge on have web development with front-end (html, css and javascript ) and also back-end (ruby, sinatra and rails. I took online tutorials mainly code-academy(profile page Mohamed bouyagui gassama) which I completed the ruby, rails, html css etc... I even bought already finish reading some programming books like learn ruby the hard way by Zed A. Shaw, the beginning ruby by Peter Cooper, ruby on rails tutorial by Micheal Harlt, (Html, css , javascript, jquery) by Jon Duckett and I'm currently studying ruby programming language by Matz and David flanaga



	What really make me a unique personality is define in the words Simple, Comprehensive, and Generous



	As an African immigrant who arrived to United States few year ago. Hoping that, this is the only country in the world where dreams can become true if you worked hard for it. I was a student in a community college due to financial difficulty. I had to dropout of college and find a  way in which I could pay my bill and take care of my parent back home in Africa. I was always passionate of technology, wondering of doing a lot of interesting stuff for myself. Unfortunately I didn't have the require knowledge to continue my goals. Then I had to take some online course which I at least 40% of my time and read books about programming on my way in subways and buses. I found that the City is giving opportunity to York to learn how to write software and become a web developer.That why I'm applying to flatiron to difference in my life and my parent. 



	My interest in learning how to write a software because it teaches you how to think in solving an important problem. it is a kind a combination of art and science. Coming up with idea, approach, methodology and testing of a piece of software that is a solution of giving problem then it is on the hand of millions of users. It is some kind of a superpower that is the most exciting for me.



	I see myself 3 to 6 months after my graduation being at the top of a Startup that I built from scratch.


	
	
	I'am have this quality of focusing on something meant to me whatever happening I never giving until I find a solution for it.
